Microservices Architecture
The system will be divided into three main microservices:

User Authentication Service: Handles user registration, login, and authentication.
Product Management Service: Manages products, including creating, updating, reading, and deleting products.
Order Processing Service: Manages order creation, updating, and retrieval.
Technology Stack
Programming Language: Python
Framework: Flask for building microservices
Database: PostgreSQL
Concurrency Control: Optimistic locking with versioning
Clustering and High Availability: Docker and Kubernetes for container orchestration
Implementation Details
1. User Authentication Service
Endpoints:

POST /register: Register a new user
POST /login: Authenticate a user and return a JWT token
Authentication: Uses JWT for user authentication and authorization.

2. Product Management Service
Endpoints:

POST /products: Create a new product (protected)
GET /products: List all products
GET /products/<id>: Get product details
PUT /products/<id>: Update product details (protected)
DELETE /products/<id>: Delete a product (protected)
Concurrency Control: Uses optimistic locking by maintaining a version number for each product.

3. Order Processing Service
Endpoints:
POST /orders: Create a new order (protected)
GET /orders: List all orders for the authenticated user (protected)
GET /orders/<id>: Get order details (protected)
Clustering and High Availability
Docker: Containerize each microservice.
Kubernetes: Deploy the containers in a Kubernetes cluster to ensure high availability. Use Kubernetes' replication and load balancing features.
Database Integration
Database Schema: Use PostgreSQL with the following schema:
users table for storing user information
products table for storing product details with a version column for optimistic locking
orders table for storing order details
APIs and Communication
RESTful APIs: Each microservice exposes RESTful endpoints.
Inter-service Communication: Use HTTP requests for synchronous communication between microservices. Implement retries and circuit breakers for robustness.
Authentication and Authorization
JWT Tokens: Protect endpoints by validating JWT tokens. Ensure users can only access their own data.
General Requirements
Code Quality: Follow PEP 8 guidelines, use meaningful variable names, and add comments and documentation.
Version Control: Use Git for version control and host the repository on GitHub.
Error Handling: Implement try-except blocks and log errors using a logging framework.
Testing: Write unit tests using unittest or pytest.
Bonus Features (Optional)
API Rate Limiting: Use Flask-Limiter to prevent abuse.
Message Queues: Use RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication.
Caching: Implement caching using Redis.
Monitoring and Alerting: Use Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and alerting.
